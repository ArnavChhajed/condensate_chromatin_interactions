Make sure you are in the genome_sim mamba environemt, which helps you organize your dependencies (what you install with mamba install)
If you try to run something and get an error, try this:
mamba install -c conda-forge PACKAGENAME
Or in the genome_sim environment, use pip install PACKAGENAME

Your script is here:

You can run cells in the notebook in vscode

You can feed the output files to chatgpt and ask it how to process the positions data to calculate metrics like radius of gyration, contact probability scaling, contact maps, etc.

Use OVITO to analyze the data:

Open the .data file generated in ovito
You’ll need to change the paths to the locations of the trajectories on your filesystem

Trajectory means group of frames (each .h5 file is a frame)

After opening .data file, add modification and enter load trajectory and put in the path to the .xyz file
